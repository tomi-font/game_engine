## Description

This:

- is a 2D video game engine written from scratch built with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
- uses the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) paradigm.
- is a way for me to experiment with some C++ features along the way.
- is not made with external audience in mind.
- doesn't have a clear direction or goal other than enjoyment.


## Dependencies

- SFML (graphics, window, system)
- Boost (MP11)
