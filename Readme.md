## Description

This:

- is a 2D video game engine written from scratch with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
- uses the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) paradigm.
- is a way for me to experiment with some C++ features along the way.
- is not made with external audience in mind.

## Dependencies

- SFML 2.5.1 (graphics, window, system)
- Boost (MP11)
